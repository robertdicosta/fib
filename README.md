# Families In Bloom, LLC
This is the website for [Families In Bloom](familiesinbloom.net), an LLC providing childbirth education in the greater Phoenix area.

## Technical Overview
This is a small static site, using a lot of hand-written markup. The only dependency is Bootstrap 4, and there are no internal build tools.

All forms and news feed widgets are plugins from Google and Facebook, managed by the client at their source. This site will likely remain static for its duration, though a micro framework and/or templating engine may be used in the future to DRY the shared layout.
