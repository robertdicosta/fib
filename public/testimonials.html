                    <p>Our classes with Lori were amazing! She was able to explain everything we could expect during
                        childbirth in a way that was easy to understand and helped take away the fear of the unknown.
                        When
                        things didn't go as expected during my labor and delivery, I felt much better knowing exactly
                        what
                        was happening and everything that the doctors were talking about because it had all been covered
                        in
                        our classes. The breastfeeding class was invaluable in giving me a head start when our daughter
                        was
                        born. It was helpful to know the different nursing positions and how to get a good latch, and we
                        are
                        still going strong after 10 months of nursing. The infant care class helped us feel so much more
                        prepared to take our little girl home. From knowing how to give baby's first bath, to diaper
                        analysis 101, and carseat safety, the class prepared us for parenthood in a way no book was able
                        to.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The classes provided a thorough, medically based, and fun education in childbirth,
                        breastfeeding, and infant care. I can't recommend these classes enough!</p>

                    <p>I have been a nurse for 24 years and 20 of those women and infant services. I have seen the
                        benefits of parents going through childbirth classes when it comes time for them to give birth
                        and care for infant afterwards. It gives them encouragement to know what to expect and raise
                        more realistic questions if needed with confidence.</p>
                    <p>The classes provided a thorough, medically based, and fun education in childbirth,
                        breastfeeding, and infant care. I can't recommend these classes enough!</p>
                    <p>Breastfeeding is natural but doesn’t natural happen as mothers expect. The classes helps to put
                        them at ease what to expect and gives helpful tips</p>
                    <p>Also a mother myself and I took those same classes. I felt more at ease what to expect and
                        confident of myself in labor and becoming a breastfeeding mom.</p>
                    <p>I recommend taking this series of classes with Lori. She creates a atmosphere of warmth as
                        potential parents gather to learn more what is to come. Will walk out with confidence of the
                        knowledge of what to expect of the coming of their child.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Becoming a parent is scary enough and giving birth. Gaining realistic knowledge will
                        benefit any
                        parent. Lori is a professional and confident at preparing potential or returning parents for
                        childbirth.</p>

                        families for

                        was the volunteer services director where Lori and I worked closely together for the benefit of
                        our community, particularly young families. She's compassionate, thorough, empathic and kind as
                        well as amazingly knowledgeable and skilled. All these traits make her an excellent teacher and
                        mentor. Lori truly has a heart to guide new and expanding families to become the best they can
                        be. It is my pleasure to recommend to anyone looking for quality childbirth and/or parenting
                        classes providing lifelong training -- well -- contact Lori. Generations of your family will be
